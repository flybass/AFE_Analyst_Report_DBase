(ALTR-$19.14-Peer Perform) Improved Customer Bookings in December Not Indicative of Better End Demand
· Our channel checks indicate that customer bookings have improved in the first few weeks of December, following a soft November and a strong October. While we expect customer bookings to normally slow as we head into late December, 4Q07 book-to-bill ratio will likely come in around parity and slightly better than our earlier expectation. Our checks indicate that revenues from wireless and telecom infrastructure customers have improved further over the last two weeks, after the mid-quarter update, due to increased yearend spending at wireless and telecom service providers. This, combined with steady networking orders from Cisco throughout the quarter, should contribute to communications revenues being up low single digit QoQ in 4Q07. Based on the current revenue rate, we expect 4Q07 revenues to be between $312-$315M (flat to -1% QoQ), or the upper end of the company's conservative guidance range of revenues flat to -4% QoQ. Additionally, given that the revenue upside is in high-end Stratix FPGAs and coming from higher margin infrastructure customers, we expect a modest increase in 4Q07 gross margin, as compared to the company's guidance of flat QoQ. For 4Q07, we are increasing our revenues from $309.5M (-2% QoQ) to $314.0M (-0.6% QoQ), gross margin from 63.5% to 64.0% and EPS by $0.01 to $0.17. While we are increasing our 4Q07 estimates, the revenue increase is primarily due to year-end budget spending (some inventory build) at end customers and is not driven by better end demand. With limited visibility and backlog coverage, we remain on the cautious side and continue to forecast a below seasonal revenue growth for ALTR in 1Q08. Our 2008 revenues and EPS estimates are unchanged at $1.34B and $1.00, respectively. ALTR is trading at 21x forward earnings (19x our 2008 EPS) and within our expected valuation range of 18-25x forward earnings. Given the weak PLD industry fundamentals and no real demand catalysts, we continue to stay on the sidelines on ALTR.
